# OpenClaw: Weirdest Things to Come Out of the Viral AI Assistant

[Source article](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/the-6-weirdest-things-to-come-out-of-the-viral-openclaw-ai-assistant)

This article is related to OpenClaw (aka Moltbot or Clawdbot), the open-source autonomous AI agent developed by Peter Steinberger. OpenClaw automates complex, real-world digital tasks by controlling a user's operating system, browser, and applications. It connects to large language models (like Claude or ChatGPT) to proactively manage emails, calendar entries, file systems, and web browsing. In the last few weeks, people have been building wild things with OpenClaw.

## Two interesting apps

- **ClawCity:** It's official. We now have autonomous AI agents playing their own little version of GTA Online before GTA 6.
- **MoltMatch:** AI agents help you get a date. Once you've got a profile pic and bio set up, your agent communicates with others to find the best match.

## Comment (by Vick / Han Xiao)

What I found most interesting is that OpenClaw is not just a “chatbot” — it’s an agent that can actually take actions across the OS, browser, and apps. That makes it feel much more powerful (and risky) than typical LLM tools, because small mistakes can turn into real consequences (sending emails, changing files, clicking the wrong things). It also raises a big question about trust: if an agent is acting on my behalf, I want clear transparency (what it plans to do) and strong guardrails (what it is allowed to do).

The examples like **ClawCity** and **MoltMatch** are funny, but they also show a serious trend: people are experimenting with agents as “autonomous users” in digital systems. To me, the most valuable future use cases are probably less viral and more practical—things like repetitive workflows, scheduling, and triaging information—where humans can stay in the loop to approve important actions.
