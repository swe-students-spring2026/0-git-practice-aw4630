This article is related to OpenClaw (aka Moltbot or Clawdbot), the open-source autonomous AI agent developed by Peter Steinberger. OpenClaw automates complex, real-world digital tasks by controlling a user's operating system, browser, and applications. It connects to large language models (like Claude or ChatGPT) to proactively manage emails, calendar entries, file systems, and web browsing. In the last few weeks, people have been building wild things with OpenClaw.

## Two interesting apps

- **ClawCity:** It's official. We now have autonomous AI agents playing their own little version of GTA Online before GTA 6.
- **MoltMatch:** AI agents help you get a date. Once you've got a profile pic and bio set up, your agent communicates with others to find the best match.
